#/ When the scale is minor (F#m for example):
#*  The first grade is: MINOR; TONALITY (F#m);

    It is maybe a useless script, because I don't really
    know which will be the exactly representation of chords,
    scales, notes, etc. I'm not sure if it is the best option
    to "calculate" the chords of a tonality, or only take it
    from a complete table.

    I'm not sure how I will incorporate another scales mode
    chords, and if it will be a good idea.

    It is only a util, whit not the best optimization.
    Greetings!
