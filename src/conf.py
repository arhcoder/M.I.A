#? [01] RYTHM PATTERNS:

    "cooling_rate": 0.98,
    "iterations": 3000,
    "selection_bias": 5,
    "dot_probability": 0.2,

    #? Set this parameters between -100 and 100 as IMPORTANCE:
    #*
    #*    1. A value of 0 will imply that the parameter in question will not positively or negatively
    #*       affect the evaluation, it will be an inactive parameter
    #*
    #*    2. A value of -100 means that it will punish that parameter to the maximum extent, to avoid
    #*       the characteristic of the parameter
    #*
    #*    3. A value of 100 means that the presence of that characteristic will be rewarded the most
    #*
    #? USE THE PARAMETERS IN A BALANCED WAY, NOT GOING TO extremes so as not to lose variety:

    "probability_find_initial_rest": 20,
    "probability_find_final_rest": 60,

    #? Uniformity is the grade on which there are
    #? repetitive use of notes figures:

#? [02] CHORD PROGRESSIONS:

    "generations_per_chord": 12,
    "mutation_rate": 0.1,
    "tournament_size": 5,
    "elitism_size": 3,

    #? FOR INITIALIZATION:
    #* In the step to initializate, the complexity is how complex the chords will be:
    #* If complexity = 0, it just will take basics major - minor (sometimes dim)
    #* If complexity = 100, it will take with some frequency complex chords as maj11, m7b5, 7#5, etc
    #/ SO, if complexity is up to 50, the chords must be more jazzy,
    #! But if the mutation rate is near to 1 (100%), then will be more possible to see rare chords,
    #! but unestable chord progressions;
    #? It has to be between 0 and 100:
    "chords_complexity": 20,
